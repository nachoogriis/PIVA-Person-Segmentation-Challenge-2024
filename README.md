This repository has been used for the 2nd PIVA Person Segmentation Challenge (PPSC-2024) for the GCED at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya. Throughout this project we have worked with a person segmentation model, which has been YoloV8, in order to predict masks for different images in our dataset. 

In [this notebook](PPSC-2024-ExplanatoryNotebook.ipynb), it can be found a deep explanation about all the project, while going through all the different stages that this project required. Moreover, by clicking at this <a href="PPSC-2024-Paper.pdf" download>link to our paper</a> you will be able to check on the different stages, technical information and results.

_Note: When the competition came to its end, private results were published. In these results we achieved a test `mIoU` of 0.874, ranking 3rd in the competition._
