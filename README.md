This repository has been used for the 2nd PIVA Person Segmentation Challenge (PPSC-2024) for the GCED at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya. Throughout this project, we have worked with a person segmentation model, which has been YoloV8, to predict masks for different images in our dataset.

In [this notebook](PPSC-2024-ExplanatoryNotebook.ipynb), you can find a detailed explanation of the entire project, covering all the different stages required. Moreover, by clicking on this <a href="PPSC-2024-Paper.pdf" download>link to our paper</a> , you will be able to check the different stages, technical information, and results.

_Note: When the competition came to its end, private results were published. In these results, we achieved a test `mIoU` of 0.874, ranking 3rd in the competition._
